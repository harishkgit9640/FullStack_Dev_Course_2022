// there are three types of we have in javaScript those are - const, let, and var

var a = 32;
var a = "raj";  // we can rewrite same variable in var
let b = "harish";
b = "raj"; // We can use like this
var c = null

console.log(b);
{
    let b = "kumar";
    console.log(b);
}
 // var cannot be differenciate values/ variable
 // always use Let for difining variable (racommanded).
 // Let is block base variable/ code.

 const Raju = 45; 
 console.log(Raju);
//  Raju = 23; // through error because constant cannot be changed.
//  let Raju = 45;  // it is not allowed
// we cannot use same variable name in Const (Constant -> which is not changeble)
